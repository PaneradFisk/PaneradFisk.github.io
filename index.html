    I'm not a webdev and probably never will be. no divs will be seen here. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

  <p id="aboutme">
    First exposed to coding, java, back in 2007 in school. The year after I did a course in webdev, thus dabbled in html, css and javascript, a bit of jquery as well.
    <br>Hated both, decided then that I would never touch coding again.
    <br>Fast forward to 2016, I'm working as a network technician, manually checking hardware configurations hundreds of times a day. "What if I could have a script do these checks for me?"
    Asked some colleagues about scripting, started dabbling with javascript and bash, didn't understand any of it.
    <br>In 2018 I decided to look into native mobile app dev, Swift was a thing and Kotlin was recently released.
    <br>Kotlin was reminding me so much of java, which I hated, but I was enjoying it! Though I did not enjoy having to battle the platform of Android. Making sure an app ran successfully on more than 8000 combinations of hardware and android versions was horrible.
    <br>Enter Swift! Support the 2 latest iOS versions and a total of 8 phone models and you're winning! Sadly it didn't lead me anywhere.
    <br>March 2021, I realized I'm not very good at UI design, decided to pick up Python instead. Building scripts and cli tooling doesn't require UI in the same way as mobile apps.
    <br>January 2022, got my first job as a developer, though Python played a very small part of it. I was forced to work in Microsofts Powerplatform, and Azure dealing with legacy PowerShell scripts, C# code and obscure SQL. Though I'd take any chance I get to write code in Python, set up a bunch of Azure Functions to be called whenever PowerAutomate or Azure Logic Apps were coming up short.
    <br>April 2023, complete burnout. Turned my back to the computer as it gave me anxiety.
    <br>About a year later in January 2024, I start dabbling with code again, this time I picked up Rust. Working so much with the cloud and low-code tools made me want to step away from it all, CLI and embedded here we come!
