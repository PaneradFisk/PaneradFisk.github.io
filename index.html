  <p id="aboutme">
    First exposed to coding, java, back in 2007 in school. The year after I did a course in webdev, thus dabbled in html, css and javascript, a bit of jquery as well.
    <br>
    Hated both, decided then that I would never touch coding again.
    Fast forward to 2016, I'm working as a network technician, manually checking hardware configurations hundreds of times a day. "What if I could have a script do these checks for me?"
    <br>
    Asked some colleagues about scripting, started dabbling with javascript and bash, didn't understand any of it.
    <br>
    In 2018 I decided to look into native mobile app dev, Swift was a thing and Kotlin was recently released.
    Kotlin was reminding me so much of java, which I hated, but I was enjoying it! Though I did not enjoy having to battle the platform Android, making sure an app ran successfully on more than 8000 combinations of hardware and androidversions.
    Enter Swift! Support 2 latest iOS versions and a total of 8 phone models and you're winning! Sadly it didn't lead me anywhere.
    <br>
    March 2021, I decide to pick up Python. Realized I'm not very good at design and building scripts and cli tooling doesn't require design in the same way as mobile apps.
    January 2022, got my first job as a developer, though Python plays a very small part of it. Forced to work in Microsofts Powerplatform, dealing with legacy C# functions and obscure SQL. Though I take any chance I get to write code in Python, setting up a bunch of Azure Functions to be called whenever PowerAutomate or Azure Logic Apps was coming up short.
    April 2023, burnout. Turned my back to the computer as it gave me anxiety.
    January 2024, picked up Rust. Working so much with the cloud and low-code tools made me want to step away from it all, CLI and embedded here we come!
